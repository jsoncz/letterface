# letterface
attempt to draw over a face with letters, like on a british passport photo.
I have only created this and experimented using Linux.

# Instructions
1 - use python3 with PIL (python image loader)
2 - check the params (arguments) to use when loading
3 - pictures are stored in the output folder

#Params
--i  [full path for the image to load]
--x  [x modulus, for manipulating the space between letters]
--y  [y ...same as above]
--size [size of the font]
--printargs [print the params on the top of the image for reference]

#TODO
improve the algos
improve the printargs option
have fun enjoying some python
